## Overview

### Problem Statement

Implement an SVM to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

### Context

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their:

1. **Effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data**.
2. **Resistance to overfitting**, especially in comparison to neural networks.

This project showcases an end-to-end workflow for training and evaluating an SVM for binary classification tasks.

## Features

- **Binary Classification**: Classifies images into either "cat" or "dog" categories.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts raw image data into a dataframe for analysis.
- **Train-Test Split**: Ensures robust evaluation through separate training and testing datasets.
- **Scalable Workflow**: Easily adaptable to other binary image classification tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - scikit-learn
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib

## Data Requirements

- **Dataset**: [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).
- **Preprocessing**: Convert images into numerical data suitable for SVM input.

### Dataset Setup

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Extract and organize the images into `cats/` and `dogs/` folders.
3. Ensure proper preprocessing to convert images into a dataframe.

## Model Workflow

The process for creating the SVM model involves the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Load essential libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load images and convert them into a structured dataframe.
   - Separate input features and target labels.
3. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the SVM model on the training dataset.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Test the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions on new image inputs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cats-dogs-svm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cats-dogs-svm
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Prepare the dataset as described in the [Dataset Setup](#dataset-setup) section.

## Usage

1. Train the SVM model:
   ```bash
   python train_svm.py
   ```
2. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_svm.py
   ```
3. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```
